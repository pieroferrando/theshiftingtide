  <h3>The Shifting Tide</h3>
  <p>At some point over the past half century, the West, led by the United States, crossed its Rubicon. Debt, dysfunction, and division ceased to be temporary bugs and hardened into structural features of the system. The era of effortless promises and unquestioned stability has given way to something different: a drift into a new order. History shows that civilizations adapt, and new systems eventually emerge. But these transitions are rarely smooth. They are disruptive and are often marked by a redistribution of power and capital.</p>
  <p>While the exact shape or timing of the next order cannot be known, the trajectory is clear: what matters now is how one endures <em>the shifting tide</em>.</p>
  <h3>Why Read This Paper</h3>
  <p>Today’s situation in the West is akin to frogs in a pot of water, slowly brought to boil. The temperature rises, yet nobody acts any differently, until eventually the frogs boil to death. If you are reading this and have a similar feeling of the rising temperature, but don’t quite understand <em>why</em> the temperature is rising, or more importantly, <em>how</em> to protect yourself from it, this paper is for you. The aim is to cut through the noise, provide a long-term perspective, and offer a blueprint for preserving wealth.</p>
  <h3>Note From the Author</h3>
  <p>After beginning my career on Wall Street, I had a visceral feeling that something was fundamentally broken in how our system operates. Rather than just march along and ignore the feeling, I chose to take a step back and educate myself on the deeper forces at play, and how they will shape my life, my family’s future, and the decades ahead. This paper is my attempt to distill those lessons and outline my thesis on how to protect wealth through what I believe will be radically different times ahead.</p>

    <!-- I. Prologue -->
    <section id="prologue">
      <h2>I. Prologue</h2>
<p class="subhead"><em>Lessons from Livy: Rome in the 90s BCE</em></p>
      <p>In the last days of the Roman Republic, the world’s mightiest state trembled under the weight of its own contradictions. Rome, rich from conquest and swollen with power, found its foundations rotting. Its allies, long denied citizenship, rose in rebellion. Economic inequality deepened, the poor seethed with resentment, and populist demagogues promised power to the masses while eroding the very institutions that bound the Republic together. The Senate, once the Republic’s anchor, bent and broke as norms dissolved and civil war consumed the land.</p>
      <p>To a patrician of that age (c. 91&nbsp;BCE), the future must have seemed uncertain but survivable, until it was not. Within decades, Rome saw proscriptions that stripped the wealthy of their fortunes and their lives, a radical reshaping of ownership, and a relentless parade of civil strife. What began as political unrest became revolution and civil war, and within a century the Republic gave way to empire. And while Augustus’ reign ultimately ushered in the <em>Pax Romana</em>, this flourishing came only after a century of chaos and destruction.</p>
      <p><em>Historia non facit saltum</em> - history does not make leaps. Systemic shifts are rarely clear to those living through them. Instead, they unfold gradually, as institutions decay in slow motion, until one day the world simply no longer resembles what it once was.</p>
      <p>Today, the Western world echoes of a similar precipice. Sovereign debts spiral, currencies erode, demographics decline, and classes clash through the wrath of the disillusioned poor. The long postwar peace, once taken for granted, feels ever more ephemeral. As with Rome, the unraveling is not yet complete, but the forces are set in motion.</p>

    <!-- II. Infection -->
    <section id="infection">
      <h2>II. The Infection</h2>
<p class="subhead"><em>Easy Money: The Great Drug</em></p>
      <p>There are countless reasons behind the rise and fall of empires, many of which have been covered in detail over millennia by greater minds and are beyond the scope of this paper. For financial markets, our focus, there is one reason in particular which stands out: <strong>easy money</strong>.</p>
      <p>Since 1945, the US dollar has underpinned global trade and finance, allowing America and its allies to:</p>
      <ul class="tight">
        <li>Borrow internationally in local currency</li>
        <li>Import goods and capital while exporting inflation</li>
        <li>Finance wars and deficits without balanced budgets</li>
        <li>Project power through sanctions and control of global payments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For eight decades, the United States and its allies have lived beyond their means, sinking ever deeper into debt. What most do not understand is that the bill <em>never</em> comes due as a monthly statement, but rather in more corrosive forms: rising inflation, eroding trust, stagnating productivity, and the gradual destruction of the very currency that enabled the excess in the first place. Eventually, debt is paid back by issuing still <em>more</em> debt, an endless cycle of money creation, until one day, the house of cards collapses.</p>
      <p>The graph below shows how this process has been unfolding over one hundred years in the United States, although a very similar dynamic has been playing out across all Western nations. Each time the system strains to its breaking point, the rules are rewritten, money is printed, and the nation buys itself another day - postponing, but never resolving, the underlying fragility.</p>
<figure class="single"><img src="figure1.png" alt="Figure 1" data-zoom /></figure>
<p><strong>So, why does this matter now?</strong></p>
<p>It matters because the easy levers to keep the game going have already been pulled: (i) devalue the currency’s peg to gold (1933), (ii) abandon the gold standard entirely (1971), (iii) cut interest rates to zero (2008), and (iv) print money through quantitative easing, i.e. borrowing money from yourself (2020).</p>
<p>As the chart below shows, these <em>easy money</em> levers have pushed the developed world back to debt levels not seen since the World War era. And although <em>easy money</em> has allowed for decades of rising living standards, booming asset prices, and abundant credit, the underlying costs have steadily piled up. Most troubling of all these <em>easy</em> levers have been used up, leaving the next generation staring into the abyss.</p>
<figure class="single"><img src="figure2.png" alt="Figure 2" data-zoom /></figure>
      <p><strong>What remains are the hard levers</strong> - measures fundamentally at odds with the democratic system, because they demand visible sacrifices nobody wants to vote for. These levers involve (i) raising taxes, (ii) cutting spending, (iii) restructuring entitlements, or (iv) defaulting on debt. Each of these imposes direct costs on powerful constituencies: voters, retirees, investors, and creditors. Unlike <em>easy</em> levers, they cannot disguise the problem; they confront it head-on.</p>

      <h2>III. The Symptoms</h2>
<p class="subhead"><em>Gradually Then Suddenly: The Silent Crisis in the West</em></p>
      <p>Reliance on easy money sets off reflexive, self-reinforcing negative feedback loops that feed on one another:
<ul class="tight">
  <li><strong>The debt burden grows</strong>, until debt service payments begin to crowd out essential spending</li>
  <li><strong>Creditors lose confidence</strong> in repayment, making it harder to borrow and driving up interest costs</li>
  <li><strong>Easy money concentrates</strong> in the hands of few, fracturing the social fabric and deepening division</li>
  <li><strong>The system weakens</strong>, leaving society fragile internally and vulnerable to external threats</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are several key indicators of these underlying distortions. While  much of the data centers on the United States given its gravitational force, the symptoms are increasingly evident across the developed world.</p>

      <h3>Debt burdens are set to rise across Western nations</h3>
      <p>Across the G7, debt burdens are on track to continue growing. Japan has experienced crisis conditions for 35 years, while Italy, France, Canada, and the UK are flying too close to the sun. Only Germany is forecast to see its debt ratio fall.</p>
      <figure class="single"><img src="figure5.png" alt="Figure 5" data-zoom /></figure>

      <h3>The bond market is becoming concerned</h3>
      <p>Despite aggressive rate cuts by central banks, long‑term yields continue to rise as investors demand higher compensation to hold sovereign debt.</p>

      <h2>IV. The Convulsions</h2>
<p class="subhead"><em>1975 vs. 2025 vs. 2075: Where We Are Headed</em></p>
      <h3>1975 to 2025: The Debt Supercycle</h3>
      <p>In 1971 the United States abandoned the gold standard and ushered in the modern era of fiat money. From then on, growth was sustained by falling interest rates, quantitative easing, and, since 2020, outright debt monetization. Assets valued via discounted cash flows - equities, bonds, private equity, venture capital, real estate - boomed as discount rates fell.</p>
      <figure class="single"><img src="figure15.png" alt="Figure 15" data-zoom /></figure>
      <figure class="single"><img src="figure16.png" alt="Figure 16" data-zoom /></figure>

      <h3>2025 to 2075: The Great Deleveraging</h3>
      <p>History offers thousands of examples of unsustainable fiscal and monetary policies destroying nations. To challenge the notion that the West is immune, consider Japan - once the world’s second‑largest economy and a symbol of hypergrowth - which has endured decades of stagnation following an epic asset bubble, despite pioneering zero rates and QE.</p>
      <div class="fig-row">
        <figure><img src="figure17.png" alt="Figure 17" data-zoom /></figure>

      </div>
      <figure class="single"><img src="figure19.png" alt="Figure 19" data-zoom /></figure>
      <p>The biggest tragedy is that of the average Japanese citizen: wages have barely moved in decades, purchasing power has eroded, and GDP per capita has steadily slipped behind peers. The lost decades reshaped the daily lives and prospects of an entire generation.</p>

    <!-- V. Antidote -->
    <section id="antidote">
      <h2>V. The Antidote</h2>
<p class="subhead"><em>Back to the Future: Anchoring on Permanence</em></p>
      <p>If the last fifty years were <em>The Debt Supercycle</em>, the next fifty may be <em>The Great Deleveraging</em>. Deleveraging can occur through repayment, default, or debasement. History suggests all three will play a role, but governments almost always choose to print money and devalue the currency - it is politically easier to quietly erode purchasing power than to impose explicit austerity or defaults.</p>
      <p>I know that I know nothing. I do not claim to know the precise path over the next decade, but after examining the symptoms and case studies, there is a high probability that within 20 years - if not sooner - the US dollar (and to a lesser extent the euro) will face a debt crisis met with enormous money printing.</p>
      <p>In such a scenario, deep value endures while speculation fails. Productive, cash‑flowing assets with scarcity and resilience tend to preserve wealth, while leveraged bets and hollow promises are exposed.</p>
      <h3>Survivors</h3>
      <ul class="tight">
        <li><strong>Hard Assets:</strong> Supply‑constrained commodities with internationally recognized value (e.g., gold, silver, energy reserves).</li>
        <li><strong>Trophy Assets:</strong> Irreplaceable land and strategically located real estate with little or no debt (e.g., productive farmland, landmark inter‑historical properties).</li>
        <li><strong>Local Productive Assets:</strong> Businesses with strong balance sheets, pricing power, and real output (e.g., cash‑rich monopolies, infrastructure providers, agriculture, critical technology).</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Foreign Currencies:</strong> Issued by nations with low debt and limited money printing (e.g., CHF, select commodity‑backed regimes).</li>

      <h2>VI. Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p class="subhead"><em>All Things Must Pass</em></p>
      <p>Past performance does not guarantee future results. The accumulated liabilities of the past era cannot be sustained forever. What was once a tailwind becomes a headwind; the very scale of the debt now constrains growth, investment, and political stability. Amid systemic shifts, the prudent path is stewardship of the scarce, the durable, and the self‑funding - assets that can survive the changing tide.</p>
